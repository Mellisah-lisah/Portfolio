        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>Hello! Am Ochieng Alice, a web developer currently a student at Moringa School based in Nairobi.</p>
          <p>Web development is a problem solving career especialy when it comes to websight creation.
            I noticed that most of the companies lack well trained web developers which has resulted to poor creation of websites
            especialy when it comes to image alighnment.
            I love playing volleyball and listening to music during my free times.
          </p>
          <p>I chose to venture into programin so as to find a way of helping such companies through coding.
            I also noticed that web developers is the upcoming job opportunity in the current world since it is growing at a higher rate compared to other carees.
